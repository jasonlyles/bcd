PARTS LIST REBUILD:
Steps:
DONE 1. Build out models/relationships
   a. color
   b. element
   c. lot
   d. part
   e. parts_list
DONE 2. Build out services for calls to 3rd parties and restrict the calls
   available to only what I need for now.
   a. Rebrickable
   b. BrickLink
DONE 3. Build out service for creating parts lists, moving it out of the job it's in currently.
DONE 4. Add interface for uploading/editing parts lists.
DONE 5. Re-style backend pages
DONE 6. Move admin controllers/views under an admin namespace. Move actions around in controllers
    from "customer-facing" controllers to admin controllers and vice versa as necessary.
DONE 7. Be 100% that:
  a. Parts can't be deleted if they belong to an element
  b. Colors can't be deleted if they belong to an element
  c. Elements can't be deleted if they belong to a lot
DONE 8. When creating/updating a part via the new/edit form, need to check BL and Rebrickable for info.
DONE 9. Add update from BL and update from rebrickable buttons to parts show page.
DONE 10. Take a look at file upload sections of forms. Might need to tweak logic if there is a file uploaded already.
DONE 11. Would be nice to have something that prompted the admin to update users about a PDF/parts_list update
    whenever one of those things got updated. Might be nice to include this in a generic notifications center.
DONE 12. Parts autocomplete in element form should have ldraw id in params at the end that
      gets stripped out before finding by name. Doing this should help us distinguish
      between different generations when selecting parts.
DONE 13. Make sure all parts_lists can be generated based off of existing BL XML files, and
    time it so I know what I can expect for downtime when I do this in prod.
DONE 14. Need to grab errors in xml parser and bubble them up to the user so they can
    see what they need to change, and if it's an error with a missing color or part,
    move past the error and keep parsing, if possible.
DONE 15. Add ability to add notes to a lot. See the flex hoses on
    file:///Users/jasonlyles/Dropbox/BCD/final_model_files/city/buildings/cb030_commercial_pack_2/commercial_pack_2.html
    to see why.
DONE 16. Should have a job that checks parts that are not marked obsolete and see if
    that status has changed. If it has, send a notification to the notification center.
    This doesn't have to run very often. Monthly maybe?
DONE 17. I'm not sure the has_access_to_parts_list? method takes into account free instructions.
DONE 18. Show user a maintenance message for any parts lists that are missing during
     the time period we're uploading new parts lists.
DONE 19. Dismissing notifications should be ajax-y.
20. Add tool to be able to update all lots at once for a given part. For example,
    there were a lot of parts lists with 4599 that needed to be changed to 4599b.
    It would be awesome to be able to do that substitution for all parts lists at once.
21. Set up the ObsoletePartsCheck job in Heroku
22. Do I need to do anything different/special for new-style parts lists for guests?
    Also, be sure that old-style parts lists downloads are still working for guests and users.
23. Sort through TODOs I've added and see which ones need to be done before this code goes live.
24. Get all the fixes in parts_list_fixes.txt sorted with Brian before this code goes live.


Seem to have left off in LdrParser#parse. Possibly in PartsListInteractions::CreatePartsList#run also

RESKIN:

* Phase 2 of new parts list:
  a. Maybe have a recommended part condition and an option for the "assemble xml"
     form in addition to "new" and "new or used" to "recommended condition". That will
     recommend new for some and used for others. We would want to recommend used on those
     elements that have gotten rare and are easier/much cheaper to find used. This would of
     course require getting some data from Bricklink and analyzing it to automate
     recommendation of a condition. N for new, U for used, nothing for no specified condition.
     Could maybe use the BrickLink.get_price_guide method and call it on each element
     via some regularly scheduled task to update prices. Not sure if this returns
     number of elements for sale though.
  b. Add a copy to clipboard button for the textarea (Might need access to a later version of javascript to accomplish this.)
  c. Maybe I can use the REMARKS field of the BL xml for any notes about the lot? idk

* Maybe don't have so much in the way of updates on the front page, and maybe just display
  the products for sale, in order of most popular. Idk that anyone wants to be going to all
  the various store pages to see everything. We don't have enough products to justify that.
* Need to set some validation to not let a user create more than the max number of authentications allowed.
* need to style devise validation messages?
* need to confirm password edit page looks good by getting an email sent for forgotten password
* Category images need to be scaled down once I figure out which images I'm using.
* Some plain pages like Privacy Policy, COPPA Policy and FAQ have plain bullets. Maybe dress them up a touch
* On the Order History page, orders with 'Gift' status are showing red, and orders with no status are showing red,
  but there is no 'email us about the issue' button
* use css clip-path to make some images Lego-shaped? https://bennettfeely.com/clippy/
  Figured out a lego-ish clip-path:
  <div class='p-0' style='<%= "background-color: #605C5B;width: 151px;height: 151px;clip-path: polygon(0% 100%, 100% 100%, 100% 67%, 95% 67%, 95% 60%, 80% 60%, 80% 67%, 70% 67%, 70% 60%, 55% 60%, 55% 67%, 45% 67%, 45% 60%, 30% 60%, 30% 67%, 20% 67%, 20% 60%, 5% 60%, 5% 67%, 0% 67%);"%>'>
    <div class='p-0' style='<%= "background-color: ##{color.ldraw_rgb};width: 150px;height: 150px;clip-path: polygon(0% 100%, 100% 100%, 100% 67%, 95% 67%, 95% 60%, 80% 60%, 80% 67%, 70% 67%, 70% 60%, 55% 60%, 55% 67%, 45% 67%, 45% 60%, 30% 60%, 30% 67%, 20% 67%, 20% 60%, 5% 60%, 5% 67%, 0% 67%);"%>'>
* Maybe replace some logo jpgs with svgs: https://worldvectorlogo.com/

* On index page, free instructions image needs to scale better. At medium?, it gets too small.
* On index page, shrink gap between intro text and news, at least for smaller than large.
* At roughly 564px wide, something is having over to the right, causing the screen to be scrollable to the right.
* Work on narrower than 480px
* Make sure it looks good on your phone

* I think total_price is not getting set correctly for some line_items: LineItem.where("total_price = '0.0'").count is higher than I'm expecting.

* I've broken the guest_registration flow (maybe. I might have fixed this)

* I have a few things to clean up that I found here: https://www.webpagetest.org/result/180716_JE_1b44040e7869b3e871c5154eeb6bec12/
  Clean those things up and the pages should load faster.
* I also have some work to do here: https://developers.google.com/web/tools/lighthouse/#devtools using the audit tab on Chrome's dev tools
  I saved an image of the baseline to the speed_test_images folder
* I believe I need to get my www to non-www redirect working properly. I can do that using instructions here:
  https://support.dnsimple.com/articles/redirect-heroku/#redirect-https
  and here:
  https://stackoverflow.com/questions/22235977/ruby-on-rails-redirecting-www-to-non-www-version-of-site

Nav:
* Account link in mobile collapsed nav hasn't quite got the right selector yet in the css. I'm
  using this in the meantime to get close: .nav-item a:hover It works, but the highlight doesn't
  go all the way across the screen like it does for the other links.

TODO:  List of the things left to do, in no particular order

HAVE TO GET DONE FOR V1:

* Instead of forcing Brian to come into the admin UI, maybe have a task that emails
  him the monthly sales CSV at the end of the month.

* Add functionality for Brian to be able to add downloads to someones account for a given product,
  in case they've had trouble downloading.

* Set up wall art, t-shirts, etc. on Printful: https://www.printful.com/?ref=index

* IPNs come to us for refunds. What should I do with those? Remove the item from the users account? Maybe I can just
store them, and not flag that there was a 2nd IPN if the payment_status for the 2nd is 'Refunded'

* I think my batchmailer jobs other than the email campaign should update something somewhere that tells me how many
emails were sent.

* Look at setting up either circleci or travis CI.

* Add Faker gem to generate a lot of orders and customers in the local database to see if I need to add any indexes to
speed up page load times.

* Try to get this app on Digital Ocean or Fly.io or something similar.

* In order to get Knowledge Panel to show up in google results, set up a wikipedia page, wikidata entry, google+ page
and verify it, maybe verify my FB and Twitter with google if possible.

* Fix up my specs so I don't have to use database cleaner, and use the truncation strategy, which slows down specs

* MUST GET OFF PEERONS IMAGES!!!!! This means getting/creating images and moving our html parts lists to the website,
and not distribute them via downloads any more. I wonder if I couldn't create some sprites where I have
an image that's not colored in, and color in according to a pieces HTML color code. That could allow me to make
several requests for images instead of hundreds for a single parts list.

* After getting off Peerons images, add network marketing.
    a. Customers who refer other paying customers can get credit towards instructions.
    b. Send out an email to all customers with a custom referral code and an instant credit.
    c. Referrers get credit to spend how they want and new customers get instant discounts.
    d. Maybe look at the language Casper uses for this type of thing.

* Figure out a way to encourage customers to post their creations built from our instructions on social media and
try to incentivize it.

* Either fix the download process for PDFs, or add something that tells people to right click and "Save As", etc. like
AWS S3 does, and like that company I bought an Access license from does when downloading.

* Build Brian an Access database that will allow him to enter customer data there instead of trying to keep track of
it all in a Word doc.

* See if I can incentivize reviews for instructions by sending people an email some number of days
after their purchase and offer them some free/discounted instructions if they'll leave reviews of the
instructions they've purchased.

* Look into adding AWS XRay, just to play around with it and get familiar.

* Check out and possibly implement http://railseventstore.org/ to create an audit log.

* See if there's a better way to handle someone going to paypal and then back to the site without doing anything. An order
is created, and the user can see it in "My Account", but should it be visible yet? Or should it just say something
relating to not having heard back from paypal about the transaction yet? Maybe that's the way, if the order_status is nil,
paypal hasn't talked to us yet, and we can say that we haven't heard back from paypal yet.

* Try to move logic out of store/products and the product_list partial and into the controller/models.

* Set up asset caching/expiry

*  Issues:
    a. Make sure batch emails go out
    b. I'm serving Images through my image bucket name, and not the cname or cloudfront.
    c. Add some stuff to protect me from some of these hack requests. Check out: https://github.com/kickstarter/rack-attack/wiki/Example-Configuration
      Also, look into seeing if I can block a specific user agent, since a lot of bad requests seem to be coming from the same user agent.
    d. Still a issue with http vs https for twitter and facebook on prettyPhoto when popping open that window.
    e. Make it more obvious how to get to the cart.
    f. Work on the ordering of products in the store... I want the popular modulars showing up first.
    g. Move sales report to a background task.
    h. Tweak my papertrail settings to filter out more unnecessary logs. I ran into my 10MB limit early today.
    i. Double check cancellation process and authentication removal process for BCD account holders.
    j. Create task that checks redis to see if there are any jobs that need to be processed. If there are, try to fire up
    a worker for that queue. Afterwards, ensure the worker is fired. The task should also fire workers if there are no
    jobs that need to be processed. This should be set up as a rake task and run via the scheduler every 10 minutes. This
    should serve as a backup to the regular hire/fire process, and should help keep a queue from getting loaded up with
    unsent emails, etc.
    k. See if I can set up anything to notify me/us on email bounces/rejects.
    l. Order confirmation emails should go to both the users email they supplied and their paypal email, unless the 2
    match. See if I can get the users paypal address back from them.
    m. Protect logged out users from having account info harvested by people using the back button. Add something to the
    layout that looks for if the back button was triggered. If it was, ajax call to the app to see if the user is logged
    out. If so, redirect to login screen.
    n. Fix image height/width on /account page. They're getting stretched.
    o. Go through recommendations in google analytics for speeding up pages and fixing user experience issues, at least
    for mobile
    p. Can maybe trim down on the size of images by having a transparent background for the large white areas.
    q. Also, can trim down on the size of images by having them processed by tinypng during the upload process. Will
    have to figure out some way to hook into carrierwave to accomplish it. Maybe a carrierwave-tinypng gem is called
    for. https://tinypng.com/developers
    r. For adding search features in the admin console, or in the front end, check out the ransack gem.
    s. Add a check to get user agent string from browser, if there is a logged in user. Store in it's own table with a
    foreign key to User. That way I can see what browser people were using when they had trouble downloading. It might
    make sense to only set this up to get stored when people go to the 'My Account' page, or for guests when they go to
    the guest download page. On the guest download page, I can grab their download token as a way of identifying them
    and look up their user_id by that download token, then store the user_id in the browser table.
    t. Convert html parts lists to be just another page in the app. There can be a parts_list page that takes an
    argument for the parts_list id and assigns to @parts_list. That can then be used to determine which partial is
    rendered out of a parts_list subdir in  app/views. The partials will just be the table with all the parts. The parts_list
     page will be everything else in the page, the js, the form, the buttons, etc. I think the better thing to do would
     be to just upload the html lists to S3, make them public, and then serve them through cloudfront. Clicking on the
     link would just pop a new tab via target=_blank and display the html file. But I don't want to do this until I've
     converted the old html lists to use the images hosted on S3.
    u. Emails not going out for parts list update. Looks like heroku wasn't notified to update number of workers for email queue.
    v. Users coming back from twitter have to accept TOS again. Bleh.
    w. Users with no orders still can't download the free instructions.
    x. Set up utm params for advertising campaigns: http://www.koozai.com/blog/analytics/utm-parameters/  Add fields in the form,
        and then use them to generate params for urls used in emails, banner ads, etc.
    y. Seems I don't have sitemaps sent to Google yet. Fix!

* FOR THE BUSINESS, NOT THE WEBSITE: Get the script working that creates images for parts, and get it to upload to
    the S3 image bucket. Then update all parts lists to use the cloudfront url to get images. Also, update the parts
    lists to use a logo I upload to S3 via cloudfront. That will ease the load of requests coming in for the logo to
    be served by Heroku.

* Set up Modernizr and https://github.com/ai/autoprefixer-rails

* See if there's any sweet animations I can put together using this: http://greensock.com/gsap

* Move javascript loading to just below closing body tag. Create something like the content_for :title for javascript
that I can put at the bottom of the layout, below the js loading, so I can have js load from a individual page, but still
load after jquery, etc. Also, set up CDN/hosted file trick like on page 355 of the javascript/jquery book I've been reading.

* Can get birthday from FB users. Maybe offer users a credit on their birthdays.

GETTING READY FOR PROD #######################################################

* Paypal!
    a. Do a test for a physical product against prod.

* Set up cron job via scheduler add-on to weekly send sitemap to google. Make sure google accepts the sitemap. It may
    not work properly to submit the sitemap from the s3 url until the https prod version is set up, because all the urls
    in the sitemap are for https://www.brickcitydepot.com  Heroku's scheduler doesn't have options for weekly or monthly,
    but I can fake it by wrapping the call to the rake task in a bash if statement:
    if [ "$(date +%u)" = 1 ]; then MY_COMMAND; fi       where 1 is mondays
    if [ "$(date +%d)" = 01 ]; then MY_COMMAND; fi      where 01 is the first day of the month

###########################
THINGS I NEED TO DO FOR LAUNCH:

* Set up maintenance rake tasks(reap stale carts, etc.)
* Set up some sort of database backup task.

##########################

##########################
IMMEDIATELY AFTER LAUNCH:

* Do a test transaction with just instructions, and one with just a physical item, and one with both.

##########################

##############################################################################

########################################################################################################################

V1.1: (Revisit this after 1.0 gets launched.)

* Make it so that the product_details action renders a page that says "We can't find that item, check out these other great items."
instead of rendering a 404 if we can't find the item.

* Some way of creating discounts for a product, or multiple products, or for an entire category/subcategory

* Have a way for customers to rate a product and leave comments about it.

* Add expires_in shtuff to pages that don't have user-specific info, or things that don't change much. Examples would be /,
   the product details pages, FAQ, contact, etc. This can avoid trips to the database for stuff that doesn't change often.
   Can check this out here: https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/http-caching-ruby-rails

* I might want a way to sweep addresses out of the database after an order has been completed for 60 days. That minimizes
   a users info in our database.

* Set up something for the instructions products model that keeps track of the version of the instructions, or at least
   the parts lists. That way, I can add something to the html parts list that does a check of BCD.com when loading, looking for the latest
   version of the parts list. Send the version number to BCD, and if there's a newer version of the parts list, return the new
   version number, and the updates. (Replaced so and so brick with so and so) so that the user can decide if they want to
   upgrade or not. This will require setting up a new model for Updates related to instructions/parts lists

* Look into adding other countries for shipping, and see what that entails, what fields I might have to add/change.
   Make sure I'm in synch with what paypal returns.

* Work on an auto-logout for timed out sessions. Through devise, I have a mechanism to expire sessions, but the site doesn't
actually redirect users to the home page, so it's not obvious they've timed out until their next request. Is this necessary,
or just nice to have?

* For the sake of smoothness, it might make sense to have TOS be its own page. That way, a guest can enter their email,
    and I don't have to give the impression that they need to check the TOS box again. Just a thought.

* Maybe make a fun maintenance page, or image for maintenance mode. Probably want to redo my 404, 422 and 500 pages.

* I just added the protected_attributes gem for trying to get on rails 4 quickly. Work on removing that by removing
attr_accessible and setting up strong params. After I've done this, try to remove this line from
config/initializers/session_store.rb: ActiveRecord::SessionStore::Session.attr_accessible :data, :session_id

* Had to comment out brakeman in Gemfile. Try adding it back periodically to see if it will play nice with the version
of tilt I have installed

* Fill out details for the Lego neighborhood extras page.

* store/products page, work on the condition that checks if product_type name is Instructions. Eventually work on
making that check if the category has subcategories, and if so, display subcategories. If there are categories,
display categories.

* I really need to spend some time cleaning and DRYing up my tests.

* Look into pros/cons of moving from thin to unicorn on heroku

* Work on adding titles to most of the customer facing pages. Also, I might want to do a little more customization
   on the facebook meta tags to reflect the current page. Maybe the product pages could have the image be the medium image.
   The description could be the product description, etc. If I'm going to do that, I'm going to need to feed that data in
   on a per page basis via some helper. I think I may have to do one or more content_for-style helpers, feed them args
   and if those args are populated, use the values, else use a default. Similar to the way I set up the title in the
   application layout.

* Think about adding a Bricklink Seller model. This could be the basis of a preferred BL seller for a given model. Say
    I arranged deals with various BL sellers to try and keep in stock the pieces needed to make a model. Then I could
    create a BL Seller, and have a join table with a BL seller ID and product ID  to tie preferred BL sellers to a given
    model.

* Work through code and apply the law of demeter to where I've chained methods for object attributes. This ought to
    help me clean up testing code also.

* I need a public page for 503s, like I have 404s, 422s and 500s

* Update Users Download Counts admin tool could use a nice search feature instead of the huge dropdown.

* Figure out how to add a feature to allow a user to get an email about a product when it's back in stock.

* Add a main flag for image model. Going forward, I can grab the image flagged main for a given product instead of
just the first image uploaded.

* Change font color or style for Admin placeholders to set them apart a bit from entered text. The gray and
black aren't distinct enough from each other.

* I need some tagging to be able to group products, such as the buildings in the Amsterdam series, SanFran series,
Richmond series, City Res, ComPaks, Alternatives etc. https://github.com/mbleigh/acts-as-taggable-on


########################################################################################################################
V1.2 AND BEYOND:

* Work on caching, starting with the most visited pages. Look into adding some caching using memcached

* Limit access to admin urls by IP

* Break products into their respective subcategories for display in the store.

* I don't like the jquery alert popup I picked and I want to change it.

* More Email Stuff!
    a. Set up a promotion email style

* Add some functionality for cancelling admins accounts

* Extend reporting on advertising campaigns. Right now I just have a total user count for an advertising campaign.
Maybe I could just have something that spit out a csv with all users created_at dates for a given campaign, and then we can
import that data into some graphing something-or-other offline.

* For errors I don't know I need to rescue, I set up exception_notification. I might want to set up exception_logger
    like I had for the reportal. https://github.com/undees/jchunky-exception_logger I think I'll see how exception_notification
    does first and if I feel I need to be logging to the database also, then I can maybe set up exception_logger also.

* Make it so ALL of my styled buttons give some indication they've been hovered over and clicked

* I might want to re-do the 422 and 500 pages a little bit. They seem... meh. Maybe freshen up the 404 page too.

* For full-site maintenance mode, I'm currently using the stock Heroku mm page. I'd like to set up a custom mm page
at public/maintenance_mode.html

* Content slider on main page:
     a.) Need to set up to position text and image. Image can have no position, peg to the top or bottom, left or right. Then I
     need to be able to do the same thing for text.

* Go through controllers and rescue potential 404s the same way I did in the store/product_details action.

* Spending tiers will earn coupon codes worth $. $50, $100, $200 and $300 will get $5, $10, $20 and $30 coupon codes.

* Make cart remove/update functionality ajax-y

* Have an order fulfillment screen for physical orders in admin area where we can change status of orders. If an item
stays in a non-shipped status for a couple of days, send a reminder email to let us know to deal with it. (Update May 2014.
The order fulfillment screen is done, but I don't yet have the reminder email set up.)

* Be able to 'gift' instructions. This tool will allow us to give a user free instructions, for whatever reason. There should be 2
forms on the page. The first will allow us to look up a user by email, and then display the items they've already purchased from us.
The 2nd form should only be displayed after the first one has been used, and will include a hidden field with the users email address
in it. It will also list out every model we have instructions for and have a checkbox next to each for easily selecting multiple
instructions. There can also be a 'select all' checkbox that will select all the instructions for gifting. This can come in handy when
the time comes to start getting the site translated, and then I can offer to give the translators all the instructions for free. Maybe
that doesn't make sense. For those users, it might make more sense if there was a tool that allowed us to just give a user access to
all instructions, always. We would want a tool like that for Brian and I and anybody else that helps us out greatly anyways. So then,
the gifting tool really just needs a combobox to allow us to gift a user 1 set of instructions.

* Set up a way to create codes that we can send to buyers from Ebay. Then, as part of the checkout process on ebay, we can send them a
link to BCD, along with a code that allows them to download from us. This will give us more control over the process, end
our relationship with yousendit, force the user to learn about our website (which will hopefully lead to future purchases on our website instead of ebay).
This will entail either an API that can be called via an ebay checkout process, or for Brian to use a tool I set up that generates a
link with a guid that can be sent to the user. The guid will essentially be a unique identifier that will link a user (presumably with no email)
to the downloads they purchased. (Update - May 2014. I have this set up, but in order to use it via ebay, I'll have to work on setting up a
custom ebay checkout.)

* Enhance the basic order reporting. I don't really like the way I did it.

* Add a friends page, where we link to Crowkillers, Dustin Crops, our Authorized Resellers, etc.

* See if it's possible to integrate with Rebrickable. They have an API at rebrickable.com/api that I could maybe use to get a users sets,
and then with those sets inventories, I could perhaps figure out how many of the pieces necessary to build one of our models a
user already had. Then I could present them with that information: "You already have 85% of the parts necessary to build this model", or
something like that. That would have to be on-demand sort of feature, that would shuffle a task into the background, and then
present the information after some processing. This would probably be a really expensive operation, and it might not be worth it,
but may be fun to try. This could possibly work using the get_set_match API, if we could pay him to upload our models as sets.

* Figure out some way to have codes that can be redeemed for x numbers of dollars.

* Admin products page could benefit from a live search feature.

* Figure out how to accommodate Lisa's letters. This would be the first product with options. Options for this particular
product would include the letter of the alphabet and a style. On the admin side, I could have a product_options table, with
fields for product_id, name, description. When a user buys a product with an option, create a item_options record. This table
would have item_id, and a number of optionx fields. Maybe 3-4 fields, so: option1, option2, etc. Make sure to include option
information in the emails, what I send to paypal (just for display purposes), and to the order fulfillment junk on the back
end. Probably the easiest way to do this would just be a static page.

* Craft (built-to-order) products should have an interest form on their product pages. The interest form could have dropdowns for
options specifically for that product. After the user has filled out the form, they can then submit the form, and it
will come to us in the form of email. In order to have the dropdowns with the options in the option families, I'll need to
implement something similar to what I was thinking of in the previous item. Probably ought to just do a static page.

* Add a task that looks for users who haven't logged in for 3 months or so and send them a "come on back" email. The
email would include products that had launched since the last time the user had logged in. This shouldn't run but once a
month or so, and when the email is sent, it should update a timestamp for the user so I know not to send the user the same
email a month later. Think about this some more...

* See about getting our domain added to some non-junk whitelists if our emails showing up in spam folders becomes a problem:

NICE TO HAVE EVENTUALLY:

* Reward users for passing the word on. If they tweet/FB/stumbleupon, digg,
or whatever, then unlock a special set of instructions. They will be able to
download that set of instructions, for free. Might want there to only be one
set of instructions they can download, or maybe let them choose from 3 or 4,
and give them ways to unlock the rest. 2 ways to handle this. Either the user
gets credited automatically, if he is logged in. Or, something gets stored in
the session and something gets posted to flash for every page that user visits
until they login/sign up. When they sign in/ sign up, will need to check to
make sure they haven't previously unlocked instructions.

* Something fun to try would be "team buying", where users
can recommend a set of instructions to a friend, and if x number of friends
buy using the recommenders recommendation, then the recommender gets free
instructions. Maybe instead of team buying, I can set it up so that every time
a user buys a set of instructions, they get 2 coupon codes that they can give
to friends to use. The coupon codes are good for maybe 25% off a set of instructions
and if the coupon code gets used, then the person who shared the code also gets
25% off a set of instructions.

* Try to decouple external resources as much as possible, so that I can
quickly switch providers if Amazon or Paypal get too expensive.

* Might want to look into customizing PDFs using PDFKit, Railscast 220.

* Right now, behavior is such that when users go to checkout, I won't let
them buy instructions they've bought before. Might want to change this to
allowing them to do so, but they're just buying more downloads at a discounted
rate.

* i18n and l10n

* Add a refund form on the individual orders page in the admin console. In order to do refunds right, I would probably
have to dip in to paypals api and have some sort of little refund button right on the order
details page. This button would kill the users link to the instructions, refund them and set the download records remaining = 0.
