# Specs in this file have access to a helper object that includes

# describe StaticHelper do
#   describe "string concat" do
#     it "concats two strings with spaces" do
#       helper.concat_strings("this","that").should == "this that"
#     end
#   end
# end
#def current_user
#  @user ||= FactoryBot.create(:user)
#end

    it "tells how many downloads a user has left" do
      @user = FactoryBot.create(:user)
      sign_in @user
      expect(helper.downloads_remaining(1)).to eq(5)
